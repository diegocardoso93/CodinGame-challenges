Goal
You must find the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

The Levenstein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits
(insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

Ex: "kitten" and "sitting". The distance is 3.

kitten -> kittin -> sittin -> sitting

NB: This distance has a wide range of applications, for instance, spell checkers, correction systems for optical character recognition and many other. 

Input
Line 1 : First string
Line 2 : Second string

Output
Line 1 : The Levenshtein distance

Constraints
The length of the strings does not exceed 50.

Example

Input
book
back

Output
